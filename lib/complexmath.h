/* IMPORTANT
 * When using this, make sure every returned value is freed up from ram 
 *   after it is no longer useful.
 * I made this with SDL2 in mind, but have made it completely independent
 *   from it so it can be used in things that don't use SDL2
 * 
 * All units used are assumd to be SI, for accuracy. 
 * Also, everything that would, only has x and y, no z, w, etc
 * 
 * All comments about what the functions do is in the c code.

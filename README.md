# small-things

These are just some small projects of mine, all of them are made and tested on ArchLinux, none of it should work on Windows without some effort.
If you for some reason want to use anything in here, there is no documentation except the comments and I won't help you if you have any issues.
There are some comments on what things are in the compile.sh.

All the compile scripts make a build directory in here, with "mkdir ../build" and puts the executable in their own directory, fun!

So far there is: monitor for a Minecraft server, slime mould simulation, hex viewer and snake (very bad).
